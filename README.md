This project demonstrates a simple Hide-Show Toggle feature in React.

It uses the useState hook to manage component visibility.

A button toggles the state between visible and hidden.

Conditional rendering ({show && <Element />}) displays content only when the toggle is active.

The implementation is lightweight and beginner-friendly.

Useful for dropdowns, FAQs, modals, and collapsible sections.

Code is clean, reusable, and easy to integrate into any React app.

This example helps understand core React concepts like state, events, and rendering logic.

Ideal for small projects, UI components, or learning fundamentals.
